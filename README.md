LaTeX concert programme template
--------------------------------

A template for typesetting the programme for a musical concert or recital using LaTeX.

Various commands are defined for piece titles and composers, an optional list of the movements in each piece and optional programme notes for each piece.

The space in between pieces is set automatically to fill the page, and the space before and after the titles can be adjusted.
